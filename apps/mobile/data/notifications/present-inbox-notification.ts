/**
 * expo-notifications bindings for inbox system notifications (RUYI-37).
 *
 * Native-touching wrapper — deliberately thin and vitest-free (the
 * vitest lane can't load expo native modules; all DECISION logic lives
 * in `lib/inbox-notification.ts` and `data/notifications/notified-cursor.ts`).
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - Local notifications only. No FCM / Expo Push (explicitly out of scope
 *     this issue; server-side push is a follow-up). That means the WS is the
 *     only trigger, which is what makes single-notification dedup tractable.
 *   - `setNotificationHandler` registers at import time (expo's own
 *     guidance) so an early notification can't race the handler. On iOS it
 *     gates foreground presentation; on Android a scheduled notification
 *     goes through the system tray either way, and `shouldPlaySound: false`
 *     there would suppress the banner entirely — keep it true.
 *   - One high-importance channel: Android 13+ gates delivery on the
 *     POST_NOTIFICATIONS runtime permission AND the channel importance.
 *   - Permission denial is a silent downgrade by design (acceptance
 *     criterion): the caller still records the cursor, so a later grant can
 *     never replay history as a burst of stale alerts.
